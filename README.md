# AquilaDB

**AquilaDB** is a **Resillient**, **Replicated**, **Decentralized**, **Host neutral** storage for **Feature Vectors** along with **Document Metadata**. Do **k-NN** retrieval from anywhere, even from the darkest rifts of Aquila (in progress). It is easy to setup and scales as the universe expands.

#### Resillient
Make sure your data is always available anywhere through any network. It is not necessory to be always online. Work offline, sync later.

#### Replicated
Your data is replicated over nodes to attain eventual consistency. 

#### Decentralized
There is no single point of failure.

#### Host Neutral
Want to use AWS, Azure, G-cloud or whatever? Got a legion of laptops? Connect them together? No worries as long as they can talk each other.

# Who is this for
* If you are working on a data science project and need to store a hell lot of data and retrieve similar data based on some feature vector, this will be a useful tool to you, with extra benefits a real world web application needs.
* Are you dealing with a lot of images and related metadata? Want to find the similar ones? You are at the right place.
* If you are looking for a document database, this is not the right place for you.

# Technology
AquilaDB is not built from scratch. Thanks to OSS community, it is based on a couple of cool open source projects out there. We took a couch and added some wheels and jetpacks to make it a super cool butt rest for Data Science Engineers. While **CouchDB** provides us network and scalability benefits, **FAISS** provides superfast similarity search. Along with our peer management service, AquilaDB provides a unique solution.
